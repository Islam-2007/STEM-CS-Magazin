            <h3>
                The Dawn of Artificial Intelligence: What It Means and Where It's Heading
            </h3>
            <p>
                Turn on the radio, call a customer service line, or scroll through social media and there’s a good chance you’re interacting with artificial intelligence (AI). From Siri and Alexa to Netflix’s show recommendations and Facebook’s feed rankings, AI is moving from the realm of science fiction into our everyday lives.
                But what exactly is AI, what does this pivotal technology mean for our future, and how might our society need to adapt to an AI-powered world?  
            </p>
            <h3>
                Defining the Game Changer
            </h3>
            <p>
                AI broadly refers to computer systems with capabilities that previously required human intelligence, such as recognizing images, comprehending language, making decisions, translating between languages, and more based on patterns in enormous data sets. While AI has been researched for decades,
                new computational power and abundant data have recently multiplied AI’s possibilities. Tech giants like Google and advances like voice assistants demonstrate AI’s new prominence.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Creativity Conundrum
            </h3>
            <p>
                AI systems like Google’s newly unveiled Gemini are even stepping into creative domains like writing coherent articles and essays that could pass as human-generated. This may raise concerns over computer creativity replacing human jobs. Yet humans seem to desire computers with an ever-increasing mastery of skills once considered distinctly human, like language, reasoning and creativity. Perhaps AI will become less a replacement, and more an augmentation and inspiration for human originality. 
                With computers crunching data, might humans have more mental bandwidth for higher-level thinking?
            </p>
            <h3>
                Preparing for Disruption  
            </h3>
            <p>
                Make no mistake – workforce disruption looms large with AI. By automating routine tasks, jobs like telemarketing, typing, warehouse picking, truck driving and more face upheaval. Yet if history holds true, AI should also drive major job growth, not just evenly across industries. To smooth this rocky transition, policy experts propose ideas like educational reform, apprenticeship programs, universal basic income - though debates rage.
                One certainty is that rapid retraining will grow increasingly essential in an AI economy marked by near-constant change.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Building Guardrails for the Future
            </h3>
            <p>
                As AI grows more powerful in exceeding human capabilities, the need for regulation and safety guidelines intensifies. Imaginations easily run towards super-intelligent AI that threatens humanity. Yet more probable in the near term is AI designed without sufficient safeguards around issues like data privacy, automated surveillance, lethal autonomous weapons and more.
                International accords combined with public-private partnerships can help institute ethical AI guardrails before it’s too late.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The AI Genie Won’t Be Put Back
            </h3>
            <p>
                While risks exist, AI could catapult quality of life to new heights across Earth’s populations. Constructing an equitable, ethical and benevolent framework for AI will constitute one of technology’s greatest priorities in the years ahead. “The genie cannot be put back in the bottle” remarks leading AI thinker Kai-Fu Lee. “The only viable strategy is to responsibly guide its development.” Our future in the era of artificial intelligence remains unwritten. With vigilance and vision, that future can still be guided positively.
                But we have much work to do now to steer this extraordinarily potent technology toward improving lives, rather than diminishing them.

                    <h3 class="title">How does AI learn?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Whether you are a technology enthusiast, or just a normal human being, you must have heard about AI and the wonders it can do, from manipulating your social media feed to match your interests, to generating a full two thousand (2000) word essay about the benefits of drinking sugar cane juice in a matter of seconds, with publicly available AI models such as ChatGPT and Google Bard being capable of understanding text, images, and audio, and producing new, never seen before,
                             pieces of data depending on the input, a question might rise in the minds of people: How did AI learn to do all of that?.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>
                            To answer the question, we must take a deep dive into the procedures necessary to build an AI model:
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            First: among a variety of AI models, one specific type of model must be selected to match with the AI’s purpose, most of the publicly available AI Models such as Stable Diffusion (a model used to generate art and images), and GPT (a Large Language Model), are classified as “Generative AI”, Generative AI models can use pre-existing data it had been trained on to create completely new information that matches the old already existing data, the new AI-Generated data might not be correct or precise by any means,
                             but it can overcome data from the same type that is generated by us, Humans.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Second: the selected AI model must be trained on pre-existing data that match its purpose, Art Generating models such as Stable Diffusion have been trained on an enormous Dataset of images and art created by humans, as an example: if someone wanted to make an AI model that can generate summarizations of textbooks, then it would need a huge amount of textbooks and already available summarizations made by humans, 
                            the larger the data available for the model to train on, the more similar the generated data is to human generated content.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Last: after selecting a type of AI model to work with, and building a large dataset of information, the model can then start to learn using the available data, AI learning can be done in many ways, the most popular method of training AI models is by Machine Learning: other than having to explicitly code the data into the AI model, Machine Learning models are used to predict and find patterns and connections between the data available, the model will not need to know the recipe to make a red velvet cake, instead, it will only need to see one and then predict its recipe, the learning process can be manipulated and pushed towards achieving more accurate results by using different algorithms and methods, 
                            a piece of the original dataset isn’t included in the machine learning model, that is because it is used to test the AI model, and the generated results are then compared to the original results and the error percentage is calculated.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            By following these steps, you can build any type of AI models that you can imagine, you can use sources such as Google Colab, and Google Kaggle, to get access to an enormous number of datasets, and learn more about the AI building process, at the end, it is crucial to maintain societal guidelines and ethical procedures in building the AI program, if such an important point isn’t considered properly, the outcome could be a devastating model that wants to take over humanity.

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                CRISPR is a gene-editing technology that allows scientists to modify DNA with unprecedented precision and accuracy. The technology is based on a natural defense mechanism used by bacteria to protect themselves from viruses. CRISPR has the potential to revolutionize the field of biology, offering new possibilities for treating genetic diseases, developing new crops, and even creating new species.
            </p>
            <!-- <img class="science" src="images/science2.png" alt=""> -->
            <h4>How CRISPR Works</h4>
            <p>
                CRISPR works by using a protein called Cas9, which acts like a pair of molecular scissors, to cut DNA at specific locations. The Cas9 protein is guided to the target DNA sequence by a small RNA molecule, which is designed to match the target sequence. Once the Cas9 protein has cut the DNA, the cell's natural repair mechanisms can be used to either delete or replace the targeted DNA sequence
            </p>
            <img class="science" src="images/science2.png" alt="">

                <h4>The Physics Behind Schrödinger's Cat Paradox</h4>
                <p>
                    Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment in quantum physics, proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It helps us understand the strange world of quantum mechanics and the concept of superposition. Here's a simplified explanation of the experiment:
                </p>
              ` <ul>
                    <li>Imagine a cat is locked in a box with a radioactive substance.</li>
                    <li>There's a 50% chance that the radioactive substance will decay and trigger a device that releases poison gas, killing the cat.</li>
                    <li>If the cat is alive, it will not be killed by the poison gas.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time until the box is opened.
                </p>
                <img class="science" src="images/physics1.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    His feline paradox thought experiment has become a pop culture staple, but it was Erwin Schrödinger's work in quantum mechanics that cemented his status within the world of physics.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Nobel prize-winning physicist would have turned 126 years old on Monday and to celebrate, Google honored his birth with a cat-themed Doodle, which pays tribute to the paradox Schrödinger proposed in 1935 in the following theoretical experiment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A cat is placed in a steel box along with a Geiger counter, a vial of poison, a hammer, and a radioactive substance. When the radioactive substance decays, Geiger detects it and triggers the hammer to release the poison, which subsequently kills the cat. Radioactive decay is a random process, and there is no way to predict when it will happen.
                     Physicists say the atom exists in a state known as a superposition—both decayed and not decayed at the same time. Until the box is opened, an observer doesn't know whether the cat is alive or dead—because the cat's fate is intrinsically tied to whether the atom has decayed and the cat would, as Schrödinger put it, be "living and dead ... in equal parts" until it is observed. (More physics: The Physics of Waterslides.)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In other words, until the box is opened, the cat's state is completely unknown and therefore, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time until it is observed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you put the cat in the box, and if there's no way of saying what the cat is doing, you have to treat it as if it's doing all of the possible things—being living and dead—at the same time," explains Eric Martell, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Millikin University. "If you try to make predictions and you assume you know the status of the cat, you're [probably] going to be wrong.
                     If, on the other hand, you assume it's in a combination of all of the possible states that it can be, you'll be correct.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Immediately upon looking at the cat, an observer would immediately know if the cat was alive or dead and the "superposition" of the cat—the idea that it was in both states—would collapse into either the knowledge that "the cat is alive" or "the cat is dead," but not both.
                    Schrödinger developed the paradox, says Martell, to illustrate a point in quantum mechanics about the nature of wave particles.
                </p>
                <img class="sciende" src="images/physics2.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    "What we discovered in the late 1800s and early 1900s is that really, really tiny things didn't obey Newton's Laws," he says. "So the rules that we used to govern the motion of a ball or person or car couldn't be used to explain how an electron or atom works."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    At the very heart of quantum theory—which is used to describe how subatomic particles like electrons and protons behave—is the idea of a wave function. A wave function describes all of the possible states that such particles can have, including properties like energy, momentum, and position.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "The wave function is a combination of all of the possible wave functions that exist," says Martell. "A wave function for a particle says there's some probability that it can be in any allowed position. But you can't necessarily say you know that it's in a particular position without observing it. If you put an electron around the nucleus, it can have any of the allowed states or positions, unless we look at it and know where it is."
                    That's what Schrödinger was illustrating with the cat paradox, he says.
                    "In any physical system, without observation, you cannot say what something is doing," says Martell. "You have to say it can be any of these things it can be doing—even if the probability is small."

            <h4>The pause in fighting has ended. </h4>
            <p>
                On the first of December, the temporary pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas ended, resulting in missile strikes and destruction once again but Israel and Hamas have both charged each other with instigating the return to conflict. Israel alleges that by refusing to release women and children detained in Gaza, Hamas violated the ceasefire. On the other hand, Hamas claims that because Israel is preventing fuel from reaching northern Gaza, 
                it is to blame for the current state of events which came only on the head of the people with more harm and destruction.

                Imagine a world where robots help you cook delicious meals, cars drive themselves, houses can clean themselves, 
                a school without human teachers, and total surgery without human doctors! This isn't just a futuristic fantasy; it's the reality we're hurtling towards, propelled by the transformative force of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

            <br>
            <p>
                AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Initially conceived in 1940s and 1950s to do simple tasks based on predefined algorithms stored in the memory, AI has evolved far beyond its initial purpose. Now, it permeated every aspect of our daily lives; it can research a vast array of topics conjuring information within seconds, make images, 
                edit videos, solve problems, make suggestions, drive cars, explain concepts, and even aid surgeons in delicate operations. The question of argue here is “Would the developments of this type of technology always lead to good results?” 
            </p>
            <br>
            <img class="newsimg" src="images/technology.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                This has sparked intense debates about its potential impact on humanity. While some argue that AI holds the key to solving complex problems and improving our lives, others express concerns about its potential to destroy humanity. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Many people think that AI has the potential to bring about numerous positive changes in society, including enhanced productivity, improved healthcare, and increased access to education.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On the other side, influential figures such as the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk think that AI development is dangerous. Stephen Hawking stated in the interview with the BBC in 2014 that AI, if not properly controlled, could surpass human intelligence, and ultimately outsmart us, leading to unforeseen consequences. Another influential voice in the discussion is Elon Musk, 
                he believes that the rapid advancement of AI technology without adequate regulations could lead to unintended consequences. It’s important to note that although there are many expectations about AI developments in the future, there is no a single evidence about that. In your opinion, will AI help or destroy humanity in the future?
